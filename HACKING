HACKING

DISCLAIMER: We realise the code doesn't necessarily follow all the rules.
This is an attempt to establish a standard coding style for future
development.

Coding style guidelines
-----------------------
Column width: 79 columns or less within reason.

Indentation: tabs (standard eight column width)
Please don't add any mode lines. Adjust your editor to display tabs to your
preferred width. Generally code should work with the standard eight column
tabs.

Try embedding as little HTML in the PHP as possible.
Consider creating templates for HTML.

MySQL queries should generally go into functions.

Submitting patches
------------------
Please submit uncompressed git-formatted patches to aur-dev@archlinux.org.
Base your patches on the testing branch as forward development is done there.
When writing patches please keep unnecessary changes to a minimum.
Smaller patches are much easier to review and have a better chance of being
pushed more quickly into the main repo.

Try to make your commit messages brief and descriptive.
