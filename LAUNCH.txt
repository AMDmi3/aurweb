This is the list of things we need to get done by 2/15 in order to make a
3/1 launch happen. Feel free to add items to it as they come up, and put "DONE" next to things as you finish them.

TIER 1 (critical)
* a package should be made of tupkg client tool

TIER 2 (pretty important)
* tupkg and tupkgs should not output unhashed passwords
* config file capability for tupkg client in user's homedir
* email notification of errors in tupkgupdate - Paul
* add foreign key constraints with on delete cascade to make sure
  entries are not orphaned in PackageSources and PackageDepends
* migrate to InnoDB tables?

TIER 3 (noncritical)
* tupkgupdate should use updatesync instead of gensync - Paul
* error message when a non TU tries to adopt packages
* add method from the web for setting/changing package category
