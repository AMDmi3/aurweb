TIER 2 (pretty important)
* config file capability for tupkg client in user's homedir
* email notification of errors in tupkgupdate - Paul
* add foreign key constraints with on delete cascade to make sure
  entries are not orphaned in PackageSources and PackageDepends
* migrate to InnoDB tables?
* tupkgupdate should not run gensync if repo is empty (but should delete
  db file if it exists)

TIER 3 (noncritical)
* tupkgupdate should use updatesync instead of gensync - Paul
* error message when a non TU tries to adopt packages
* add method from the web for setting/changing package category
* tupkgupdate should have a flag to keep it from modifying the repo if
  suddenly all the PKGBUILDs disappear from the CVS dir (probably an error
  not actual clearing house)
