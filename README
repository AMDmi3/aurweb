Arch User Repository (AUR)
===================

About:
=====
The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a framework for hosting a collection of
packaging scripts that are created and submitted by the Arch community. The
scripts contained in the repository (PKGBUILDS) can be built using the Arch
building/packaging script (makepkg) and installed via the Arch pacman manager
(pacman). The AUR project aims to provide the necessary web interface, database
schema, and scripts for a multi-lingual community-driven repository.

Functionality:
=========
-Users may submit source packages that contain a PKGBUILD
-User accounts with varying permission levels (User, Trusted User, Developer)
-Ability to search for specific submitted packages (based on package name,
package description, package submitter, package maintainer)
-Display submitted package information by parsing PKGBUILD (description,
license, package dependencies, etc)
-Users can make comments on package information page
-Mark packages as out-of-date
-Vote for well-done and popular user submitted packages
-Trusted User and Developer have ability to search for and modify accounts
-Area for Trusted Users
and Developers to post AUR-related proposals and vote on them
