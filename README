Arch User Repository (AUR)
==========================

The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a framework for hosting a collection of
packaging scripts that are created and submitted by the Arch community. The
scripts contained in the repository (PKGBUILDs) can be built using makepkg and
installed via the Arch package manager pacman. The AUR project aims to provide
the necessary web interface, database schema, and scripts for a multi-lingual
community-driven repository.

Functionality
-------------

* Users may submit source packages that contain a PKGBUILD.
* User accounts with varying permission levels (User, Trusted User, Developer).
* Ability to search for specific submitted packages.
* Display package information by parsing meta-data provided with the packages.
* Users can make comments on package information page.
* Mark packages as out-of-date.
* Vote for well-done and popular user submitted packages.
* Trusted User and Developer can search for and modify accounts.
* Area for Trusted Users to post AUR-related proposals and vote on them.
