TODO

Here's a list of things that currently need doing in the AUR which
aren't bugs that need investigation, they just need some time to fix.
Don't forget to remove anything from this list that gets fixed if you
can and feel free to add to it.

* HTML basically needs a complete rewrite, rife with broken html
* Use mod_rewrite for urls, allows for nicer looking urls and no more
  deciphering of those insane variables
* Rename those insane variables (the url variables on the search page),
  probably make them more verbose and actually relate to what they are
* Set up redirects for useless pages (like the "you've done action to X"
  package pages), FS#3542
* Add confirmation for TUs deleting packages, FS#6515
* Ownership of packages should turn notify on (adopt, create, etc.), FS#10480
* Bad hyphens in RSS feed, FS#10706
- Shuffle around secondary nav links (does every page really need
  bugs/discuss/etc? front page material?)
- search page formattting (squashed columns)
- improve package searching (fulltext is nifty, needs discussion)
- [community] scripts should handle -arch suffixes (FS#9449)
