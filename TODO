TODO

Here's a list of things that currently need doing in the AUR which aren't bugs
that need investigation, they just need some time to fix. Don't forget to remove
anything from this list that gets fixed if you can and feel free to add to it.

Todo List
---------
* HTML basically needs a complete rewrite, rife with broken html
* Use mod_rewrite for urls, allows for nicer looking urls and no more
  deciphering of those insane variables
* Rename those insane variables (the url variables on the search page),
  probably make them more verbose and actually relate to what they are
* Set up redirects for useless pages (like the "you've done action to X"
  package pages), FS#10674, FS#3542
* Add support for the license field in tupkg scripts, FS#8138
* Add confirmation for TUs deleting packages, FS#6515
* Ownership of packages should turn notify on (adopt, create, etc.), FS#10480
* Bad hyphens in RSS feed, FS#10706
* Add "package download counters", for tarballs and PKGBUILDs, FS#7780, FS#3094
- Shuffle around secondary nav links (does every page really need
  bugs/discuss/etc? front page material?)
- search page formattting (squashed columns)
- improve package searching (fulltext is nifty, needs discussion)
- [community] scripts should handle -arch suffixes (FS#9449)
