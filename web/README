Web Interface:
==============

Directory Layout:
-----------------
./html        - DocumentRoot for AUR, where the PHP scripts live.
./html/css    - CSS stylesheets
./html/images - Any AUR images live here.
./lib         - Supporting PHP include files.  Access denied to Apache.
./template    - Where most of the html markup resides and minimal
                amount of PHP scripting.

		There is also a template to model the site's top pages
		in template.phps


Scripts:
--------
- lib/aur.inc
  This is where we can stick functions that can be shared
  between the various scripts.  Also a good place to put the
  MySQL authentication variables since it should live outside
  the DocumentRoot.

- html/login.php (probably index.php)
  PHP script to handle logging users into the AUR web site.  It
  authenticates using the email address and a password against
  the Users table.  Once authenticated, a session id is generated
  and stored in the Sessions table and sent as a cookie to the
  user's browser.

- html/logout.php
  PHP script to logout.  It clears the session id from the
  Sessions table and unsets the cookie.

- html/account.php
  PHP script to handle registering for a new account.  It prompts
  the visitor for account information: Email, password, real name,
  irc nick.  The info is recorded in the Users table.  Perhaps later,
  we can add a preferences field that allows the user to request to
  be notified when new packages are submitted so that they can cast
  votes for them?

  If a TU is logged into the system, they can edit accounts and set
  the account type (regular user or TU).  If a Dev is logged in, they
  can also set the account type to Dev.  TUs and Devs are able to
  delete accounts.  If an account is deleted, all "Unsupported"
  packages are orphaned (the MaintainerUID field in the Packages
  table is set to NULL).

- html/packages.php
  PHP script to search the package database.  It should support
  searching by name, category, maintainer, popularity, etc. It
  should resemble the packages.php script on archlinux.org. A
  checkbox should be included next to each package to allow
  users to flag a package out of date, adopt it, and vote for
  it (and reverse operations).

- html/pkgsubmit.php
  This is the PHP script that allows users to upload a new package.
  The package format will be a tgz containing the PKGBUILD,
  scriptlets, and patches necessary to build the package from
  source.  Initially, the user submitting the package can select
  its category (network, devel, etc) but that can be modified
  later by the adopting TU.  The script makes appropriate entries
  into the database (and perhaps notifies interested users of the
  new package).
